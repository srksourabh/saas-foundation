## Project metadata
- **Created**: <date>
- **Stack**: Next.js 16 + tRPC + Drizzle + PostgreSQL
- **Auth**: <auth-provider>
- **Deployment**: Vercel (web) / Docker (services)
- **Repository**: [repo URL]

## Architecture decisions

Chronological log of significant decisions. Each entry links to a full ADR
in `docs/ADR/` for deeper context.

### ADR-001: Auth strategy
**Date**: <date>
**Decision**: <auth-provider>
**Reason**: Standard choice for TypeScript SaaS — good developer experience,
out-of-the-box OAuth support, self-hosted (no vendor lock-in).
**Trade-offs**: Must manage session invalidation ourselves; less feature-rich
than managed providers like Clerk or Auth0.
**Link**: `docs/ADR/adr-001-auth-strategy.md`

### ADR-002: Database ORM
**Date**: <date>
**Decision**: Drizzle ORM
**Reason**: Lightweight, SQL-like API, good TypeScript inference, fast
migrations (no engine binary). Prisma has better DX for complex relations
but is significantly heavier.
**Trade-offs**: Less mature relation handling than Prisma; more SQL knowledge
required. More control over queries.
**Link**: `docs/ADR/adr-002-database-choice.md`

### ADR-003: Monorepo tool
**Date**: <date>
**Decision**: Turborepo + pnpm
**Reason**: Industry standard for TypeScript monorepos, parallel execution,
caching. Lighter and faster than Nx for a SaaS starter.
**Trade-offs**: Nx has more advanced code generation; Turborepo requires
manual task configuration.

### <YYYY-MM-DD>: <Summary of what was done>
- **Work done**: [describe features built, bugs fixed, decisions made]
- **Files touched**: [list files created or modified]
- **Decisions**: [any ADRs created or design choices made]
- **Blockers**: [anything blocking progress]
- **State**: [current status of ongoing work]
- **Next**: [what should be worked on next session]

<!-- Example:
### 2026-07-12: Implemented authentication flow
- Work done: Set up NextAuth v5 with Google OAuth + email/password
- Files touched: packages/auth/, apps/web/app/(auth)/, packages/db/src/schema/users.ts
- Decisions: Using database sessions (not JWT) for better control
- Blockers: Need Google API credentials from admin
- State: Auth works locally. Signup form complete. Email verification pending.
- Next: Wire up Resend for welcome emails, add password reset flow
